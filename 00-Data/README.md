# Data-Related Utilities

Notebooks and utilities in this directory are intended to provide skeleton frameworks or examples for accessing, downloading, and otherwise processing data related to the [CrisisFACTS](http://crisisfacts.github.io) [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov) track.

For 2022, the main resources here are for downloading track data using the `ir_datasets` package. This package facilitates rapid collection and easily porting the CrisisFACTS IR datasets to Pandas or other format.
